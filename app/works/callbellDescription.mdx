Callbell is a collaborative multi-agent platform for sales and support agents to manage leads and conversations through their communication channels (WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, and Instagram). I joined the team as a full-stack developer and was responsible for both frontend and backend development. My main focus was to build a modern and performant frontend and a robust backend.

I had the chance to work with many different technologies and languages, such as React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions, AWS, and Golang, among others. It was a great opportunity to work with an amazing team and to learn new things. I grew a lot as a developer and as a person. Many thanks to the team for the opportunity to work with them.

###### Projects

I have been involved in many projects; some of them are:

**Chat Module**: I maintained and improved the chat module of the platform, which is the main way to communicate with customers. This was a critical part of the platform, so I had to ensure that the chat module was working properly, avoiding bugs and issues. Testing was a must.

**CRM Module**: I took responsibility for building the entire CRM module, which allows agents to manage leads and conversations. I built the entire module from scratch, including both the backend and the frontend. I used Ruby on Rails for the backend and React for the frontend.

**Public API**: We built a public API for the platform, which allows agents to integrate the platform with other systems. We used Rails since it was the main language of the team.

**Zapier Integration**: I developed a Zapier integration for the platform, which allows agents to connect the platform with other systems using Zapier. It was fun to see how Zapier worked and how to build an integration for it.

**Redesign**: We redesigned the frontend of the platform, which was built using React. I built the entire frontend from scratch, including the components, pages, hooks, and services. I used Tailwind CSS for the design of the components.

There are many more projects I have been involved in. I also worked on the mobile app of the platform, which is a React Native app, and on many other features and improvements built internally to enhance our team's productivity.

The most important thing I learned from this project is the significance of teamwork and collaboration among team members. I learned a lot from the team and from the other developers I worked with.

The collaboration ended because I needed to take a break and focus on my personal life.
