Callbell is a collaborative multi-agent platform for sales and support agents to manage leads and conversations through their communication channels (WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, and Instagram). Here I joined the team as a full stack developer and I was responsible for the frontend and backend development. My main focus was to build a modern and performant frontend and a robust backend.

I had the chance to work with many different technologies and languages, such as React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Docker, Terraform, Github Actions, AWS, Golang, among others. It was a great opportunity to work with a team of amazing people and to learn new things. I grew a lot as a developer and as a person. Many thanks to the team for the opportunity to work with them.

###### Projects

I have been involved in many projects, some of them are:

**Chat Module**: I was able to maintain and improve the chat module of the platform, which is the main way to communicate with the customers. A very critical part of the platform, hence I had to ensure that the chat module was working properly, avoiding bugs and issues. Testing was a must.

**CRM Module**: I took responsibility for building the entire CRM module, which is the module that allows the agents to manage the leads and conversations. I had to build the entire module from scratch, including the backend and the frontend. I used Ruby on Rails for the backend and React for the frontend.

**Public API**: We had to build a public API for the platform, which allows the agents to integrate the platform with other systems. We used Rails since it was the main language of the team.

**Zapier Integration**: I had to build a Zapier integration for the platform, which allows the agents to integrate the platform with other systems using Zapier. It was fun to see how Zapier worked and how to build an integration for it.

**Redesign**: We had to redesign the frontend of the platform, which was built using React. I had to build the entire frontend from scratch, including the components, the pages, the hooks, the services, among others. I used Tailwind CSS for the design of the components.

There are many more projects that I have been involved in. I also worked on the mobile app of the platform, which is a React Native app, and many other features and improvements built internally for our team to improve our productivity.

The most important thing that I have learned from this project is the importance of the team and the collaboration between the team members. I have learned a lot from the team and from the other developers that I have worked with.

The collaboration ended because I needed to take a break and focus on my personal life.
