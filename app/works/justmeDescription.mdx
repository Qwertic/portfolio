This was a Full Stack developer role where I was responsible for the frontend and backend of the application. I was also responsible for the database and the deployment of the application. It was a great but very challenging role. I had to learn a lot of new things to be able to work as a full stack developer. I was responsible for the design of the application using Figma. I also had team leader responsibilities. This experience was very valuable, and I learned a lot from it.

The project was about the management, portability, and visibility of personal data; compliance with GDPR was the main goal.

We were based in Paris, France 🇫🇷. StationF (the biggest startup campus in the world) was our home base.

###### Projects

**CRM**: I managed to build a CRM for the app. Using OSS libraries made it easier. 🙏🏻

**Redesign**: I was involved in the redesign of some parts of the app; major and minor changes were made.

**Third-party API integrations**: I created connectors for external APIs in the app, like Stripe, Zendesk, Mailchimp, and SendingBlue, to get user information from those external apps.

**Components Library**: I created a small components library to use internally, mostly to make my life easier. 😜

**Refactor**: I contributed to some refactoring in the app as well.

The project ended in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. 😷
