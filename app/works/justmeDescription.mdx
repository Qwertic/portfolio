This was a Full Stack developer role where I was responsible for the frontend and backend of the application. I was also responsible for the database and the deployment of the application.
It was a great but a very challenging role. I had to learn a lot of new things and to be able to work as a full stack developer. I was responsible for the design of the application using Figma. I had team leader responsibilities too. This experience was very valuable and I learned a lot from it.

The project was about management, portability and visibility of personal data, compliace with GDPR was the main goal.

We were based in Paris, France. StationF (the biggest startup campus in the world) was our home base.

**Third party API integrations**: I created connectors for external APIs in the app, like Stripe, Zendesk, Maichimp, SendingBlue in order to get user information freom those external apps.
