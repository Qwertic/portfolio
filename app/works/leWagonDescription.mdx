It all started with a bootcamp at Le Wagon in Milan ðŸš€.

An intense 9-week bootcamp that taught me the what, how, and why of web development. I learned new skills and was able to work as a full-stack developer. I collaborated with amazing people and worked as a team. This was the first step toward becoming a full-stack developer. Of course, I had to learn a lot of new things, and my journey began before the bootcamp, in my room, while I was trying to understand what programming is. Days and nights were spent grasping how to solve problems, how to code, how to think, how to learn, how to understand, and how to be a good developer. The bootcamp was a huge boost for me and my career.

I have never stopped learning since then.

### Projects

**HolyTrip**: A trip planner app that allows you to plan and share information about the trip with the participants! This was the final project that we worked on in our team of three. We planned, designed, and built the app entirely.
