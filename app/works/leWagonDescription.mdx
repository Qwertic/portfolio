It all started with a bootcamp at LeWagon in Milan ðŸš€

An intense 9-week bootcamp that taught me the what, how and why of web development. I was able to learn new things and to be able to work as a full-stack developer. I was able to collaborate with amazing people and to be able to work as a team.
This was the first step to be able to work as a full-stack developer. Of course, I had to learn a lot of new things and to be able to work as a full-stack developer. It started before the bootcamp to be honest, in my room while I was trying to understand what programming is. Days and nights grasping my mind on how to solve problems, how to code, how to think, how to learn, how to understand, how to be a good developer.
The bootcamp was a huge boost for me and my carrer.

Never stoped learning since then
