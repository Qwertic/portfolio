## Life as a journey

Life is a journey, and in one journey there may be many different lives. In my previous life I was a cook, and I loved it. I loved to cook, but the environment was so toxic that was no good for me. As a [Highly Sensitive Person](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Highly_sensitive_persons) I couldn't last long in a high stress environment like that.

It was not until I was 27 or 28 that I decided to bring a major change in my life. I started to learn to code in my room, in my free time. Little by little I started to understand the world of programming, and I started to love it. I started to love the feeling of creating something from nothing, of solving problems. It was giving me the feeling of a new challenge, and a new adventure.

## A new journey has started

This journey started in my room, but after 2 years I realised that I needed a boost, and I needed to go to a more advanced course. I started to search for it, that's where I found about coding bootcamps.

After carefull research I found out about [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/). I decided to attend a coding bootcamp in Milan, Italy. It was a very intense and exciting journey for me. I met many interesting people, and I learned a lot of new things. I had a great time, and I enjoyed it a lot.
I have beautiful memories of it.

It was one of the best decisions I made in my life. Very challenging but rewarding at the same time. I had the chance to work in a team, to collaborate in projects and to learn so many new things.

## Ups and downs

Breaking into the world of programming was not easy. It was hard to find a job with no experience, the market was not very friendly. I had to face the reality outside of the bootcamp. Once you get out, the experience that you have is not enough unfortunatelly.

Lucky me, the teacher from the bootcamp, Francesco, a very nice person, proposed me to a French company called _JustMe Technologies_. They were looking for a Full Stack Developer, little experience was not a problem for them. We did an interview and they asked me to join them in Paris. I surely wanted to go, and I was happy to join.

Paris was an incredible place to be, I loved it! We were based in [StationF](https://stationf.co/), the world's biggest startup campus. I had a great time there, the culture, the people, the food and the vibe was amazing ðŸ’–

The job wasn't as I expected though, it was quite challenging, and quite demanding. I had to learn and do many new things. I was supposed to have a mentor but I didn't. Learning the hard way was the only way to go. Most of the time I was working on my own and had no idea what I was doing. Imposer syndrome was hitting me, but I kept going.
It was rewarding to see the code working, and to see the product evolving. I was proud of myself, and I was happy to be able to do it. I was able to learn a lot of new things, and I was able to do it in a new environment. I was able to meet new people, and I was able to make new friends.

At the same time it was stressful to not know what I was doing all this time, having a mentor would have been a big thing for me.

## Guidance from a mentor

After this project was finished, and after a short break, I started to look for another project to work on. The search was not easy because of my limited experience, but again I was lucky. [Callbell](https://callbell.eu/) was looking for a Full Stack Developer to join them, after a pleasant chat with Gianluca the CTO, I was able to join them. ðŸŽ‰

I finally found a mentor, learning from him was a big thing for me, a very experienced developer, patient and helpful person. Forever grateful to him.

Here I was able to learn more than expected, I had the chance to work with different technologies, collaborate with different people and have a great time. Challenges were always there, but I was able to overcome them.
I also had the chance to build skills, like communication, teamwork, leadership, etc. Being a small team we all were owners of the projects that we were working on. We had a great culture, and we were able to do it.
We planned, designed, developed and deployed a lot of projects, and I was able to see the product evolve and scale.

## What's next?

I don't know what's next for, I just have to open and things will come, as usual :)
