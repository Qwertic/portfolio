## Feeling different

I've always felt like I don't quite fit in. Always thought that I was a bit different. The way I think, the way I see, the way I feel. I've always been like this.
All the misundestandings, the struggles, the isolation, the loneliness, the need to belong, to adapt, to change, took me away from myself.

As an adult, I found myself not knowing who I am, but I've learned to know myself better, to understand myself better and to accept myself better. I have new tools to understand the mind, the thoughts, the feelings. I can finally understand why I am the way I am and I can finally be who I am.
No more need to adapt, to be someone else. No more need to fit in. No more need to belong. I can finally be myself. I can create my own path and help others to do the same.

## Finding out

I didn't know I was on the spectrum until a couple of years ago. While going to therapy, we dicussed about it and I've done some quizzes about it. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism, intitially it was a relief, I've always suspected that. Or was I just waiting for an excuse to just be who I am?
Diagnoses might be a good and a bad thing, It can be a relief of it can become a burden.
I started to justify some behaviours and started behaving according to the manuals, and that's because I have been told to behave or not in certain ways, I was re-learning and it was be very energy-consuming. We underestimate our energy-managment and given the fact that HSPs can get overwhelmed more easily, knowing that you need to manage your energy accordingly is a game changer.

I was getting into a bubble, the neurodivergence bubble. I love the idea of this social movement and empowerment but then it's easy to get into some "us and them" dynamics. We the neurodivergent and the others. That does only create distance and it's not helpful for anyone. Neurodivergent people need the "others" and vice versa. We are one and we must learn to be one
Just like every bubble, it can be safe but it can isolate you from the rest of the environment and when it pops, well it can be painful.

## Getting out

Getting out there was the best thing for me, it took me time and energies, I quit my job, took some time off, travelled around, met new people, made new friends, and I'm still making new friends.

Therapy was usefull, it led me to know myself better, to understand myself better and to accept myself better.
But I'm the one that made the changes, the one that decided to get out of the bubble, the one that decided to be myself.

What worked most for me was to challenge and face my fears, to be myself, to be true to myself.
Meditation is helping me to be in the present, to be in the now, to be myself, to be true to myself. It's a great tool and the only practice that everyone should practice to discover themselves.

If everyone does their own homework, well the future could be the brightest, but we should take care of the present, that's the most important moment to take action.

## The present

I'm still learning, still growing, still challenging myself. I'm still facing my fears, being myself, being true to myself. I just know a little more, yet I know very little about myself
