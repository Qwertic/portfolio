## Feeling different

I've always felt like I don't quite fit in. Always thought that I was a bit different. The way I think, the way I see, the way I feel. I've always been like this.
All the misundestandings, the struggles, the isolation, the loneliness, the need to belong, to adapt, to change took me away from myself.

As an adult, I've learned to know myself better, to understand myself better and to accept myself better. I have new tools to understand the mind, the thoughts, the feelings. I can finally understand why I am the way I am and I can finally be who I am.
No more need to adapt, to be someone else. No more need to fit in. No more need to belong. I can finally be myself. I can create my own path and help others to do the same.

## Finding out

I didn't know I was on the spectrum until a couple of years ago. While going to therapy, we dicussed about it and I've done some quizzes about it. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism, intitially it was a relief, I've always suspected that.
After some time researching, reading books, listen to podcasts, I was geting into the spectrum bubble, I was learning about the differences between us and neurotypical people. I was learning about the strenghts and weaknesses of being on the spectrum.

The risk of getting into the bubble is that the bubble can then become a prison. The feeling of "being different" can then become a reason to give up.

There was a decline in my mental health, my isolation, my loneliness, my need to belong. I was getting more and more into my own world, my own thoughts, my own feelings. I was getting more and more into my own bubble.

## Getting out

Getting out of the bubble was the best thing for me, it took me time and energies, I quit my job, took some time off, travelled around, met new people, made new friends, and I'm still making new friends.

Therapy was usefull, it led me to know myself better, to understand myself better and to accept myself better.
But I'm the one that made the changes, the one that decided to get out of the bubble, the one that decided to be myself.

What worked most for me was to challenge my fears, to face my fears, to be myself, to be true to myself. Meditation is helping me to be in the present, to be in the now, to be myself, to be true to myself.
I can do it on my own, but still able to ask for help when I need it.

## The present

I'm still learning, still growing, still challenging myself. I'm still facing my fears, being myself, being true to myself.

I'm grateful for what it was, for what it is, for what it will be.

I'm grateful for the people that I've met, for the people that I've known, for the people that I've loved.

I'm grateful for the challenges that I've faced, for the struggles that I've overcome, for the changes that I've made.
