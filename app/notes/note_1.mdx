## Motivation

Hello 👋 I'm Qwertic.

You'll get to know me better reading my notes in this blog. I write code, build stuff, explore life. I express myself in different ways.
So many lives in one. So many things to do, yet so little time around.

Starting a blog is a great way to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects. It's a way to express my thoughts, and to share my ideas with the world.
Since I'm on the neurodivergent spectrum, expressing my thoughts, ideas, emotions and feelings has always been hard for me, writting them down is the best way to do it. I've been holding my thoughts and feelings for too long, and I've been afraid to share them with the world. But then how can the world know what I'm feeling or thinking?

Blogging could be great for me, even if I don't know what to write about, even no one will read it. I just want to share.

This blog and website have been created while learning about nextJS 🤓

## What's next

I'll try to keep it up and add more thoughts, ideas and notes about me, my life and work. I might not be consintent, that's going to take some time, but I'll get there at some point
Might add a newsletter later on, who knows 😜
