## Motivation

Hello üëã I'm Qwertic. I'm a software developer, a curious being, and a tinkerer. I'm also a neurodivergent person, and I'm proud of it.

Starting a blog is a great way to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects. It's a way to express my thoughts, and to share my ideas with the world.
Since I'm on the neurodivergent spectrum, expressing my thoughts, ideas, emotions and feelings has always been hard for me, writting them down is the best way to do it. I've been holding my thoughts and feelings for too long, and I've been afraid to share them with the world. But then how can the world know what I'm feeling or thinking?

Blogging could be great for me, even if I don't know what to write about, even no one will read it. I just want to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects.

This blog and website have been created to help me to share my thoughts, ideas, projects and something about me.

## What's next

I'll keep adding more posts, and I'll keep adding more projects. I'll keep adding more thoughts, ideas, and feelings. I'll keep adding more about me.
